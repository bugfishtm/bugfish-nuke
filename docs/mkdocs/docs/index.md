## Features

This tool provides instant, secure erasure of user data, application traces, and sensitive files with a single click. It uses advanced deletion methods, overwriting files rather than simply moving them to the recycle bin, and allows users to set the number of overwrite passes for each operationâ€”balancing speed and security according to their needs. For added flexibility, users can integrate their own scripts, such as automatically dismounting encrypted volumes during the cleanup process.

An optional, advanced feature lets users corrupt Windows login files after deletion, effectively locking out further access to the system (intended for emergency scenarios only). To enhance the user experience, the tool can play a custom or built-in music track during deletion, providing an audible signal when the process is complete. Before any action is executed, users receive a clear overview of what will happen, and can configure post-deletion behaviors such as auto-closing the tool or forcing a system restart. Direct access to tutorials and help resources is also available for guidance and support.

**Warning:** Use the "Corrupt Windows System" option only in extreme situations. This action is irreversible and will require a full system reinstall.

## Security Notes

- **Overwriting:** Files are overwritten according to your settings, making recovery nearly impossible.
- **Recycle Bin:** Emptied using Windows default; secure overwrite for the bin may be added in future versions.
- **Custom Scripts:** Scripts run independently and can be used to automate additional emergency tasks.
- **File Deletion:** Files are securely overwritten (unless you set passes to 0), making recovery extremely unlikely.
- **Music Player:** It provides an audible signal when the deletion process is finished, useful if you need to leave your computer during an emergency wipe.
- **Use with Caution:** Bugfish Nuke is designed for emergency situations. Use with care, especially the destructive system options.

> **Warning:** Use the "Corrupt Windows System" option only in extreme situations. This action is irreversible and will require a full system reinstall.
